<h2>Building mating nucs</h2>

<p>There are many styles of mating nucs. We use at least 4 different types in our operations. Each Style has its advantages and disadvantages. We will cover them in other workshops.</p>

<p>Our primary style is what we call a Kootenay nuc as its origins to us. </p> 

<p>This design is for mating queens The frames are of standard Dadant depth but only the width of a standard box. The box has the side wall instead of the ends rabbited for the frame ends. </p>
<img src="http://beemaster.ca/images/apis/xwaysweb.jpg" width="600" alt="">
<p>We use this configuration to over winter the bees and population of the frames with brood, bees and resources. 
This will be covered in  <a href="https://www.computersystemconsulting.ca/whmcs/cart.php?a=add&pid=102" target="_blank">a future Anu workshop</a>.
</p>
<h3>What we will cover.</h3>

 <li>The principles of what is necessary to successfully mate a queen.</li>
 <li>The design of Kooteny. How this system accomplishes this goal.</li>
 <li>Materials needed.</li>

 <li>Cutting and assembly, jigs and techniques to get the job done.</li>
