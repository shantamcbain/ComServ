# SOME EXTRA TECHNICAL NOTES FOR THOSE INTERESTED:
#
# This script was inspired from Matt Sergeant's 
# addition to the mod_perl guide where he
# explained why catching $SIG{__DIE__} as 
# well as using CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser) 
# does not really work except in the simplest
# of situations.
#
# Thus, we have switched to using this debug script
# as a means to catching exceptions on the fly
# and outputting them to the browser.
#
# The mod_perl guide can be found at
# http://perl.apache.org/
